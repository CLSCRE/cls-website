      <p>Securing a commercial real estate loan is a fundamentally different process from getting a home mortgage. Residential lenders focus primarily on the borrower's personal income and credit. Commercial lenders evaluate a more complex picture: the property's income-generating ability, the borrower's net worth and liquidity, and the specific market dynamics for the asset type and geography. Here is a comprehensive guide to what lenders actually examine and how to position yourself for the best possible outcome.</p><h2>The Five Pillars of Commercial Loan Qualification</h2><h3>1. Property Cash Flow (NOI and DSCR)</h3><p>In commercial real estate, the property itself is the primary underwriting focus. Lenders begin by analyzing the property's Net Operating Income (NOI) — gross revenue minus operating expenses — and verifying that it adequately covers the proposed debt service (the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, or DSCR).</p><p>Most lenders require a DSCR of 1.20x-1.30x, meaning the property generates 20-30% more income than the loan payment. The higher the DSCR, the more comfortable the lender — and typically, the better the loan terms.</p><p>Lenders verify income through trailing 12-month operating statements, rent rolls showing actual leases, and tax returns. They apply their own vacancy and expense assumptions rather than taking your numbers at face value.</p><h3>2. Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)</h3><p>LTV is the loan amount expressed as a percentage of the property's appraised value. A $3 million loan on a property appraised at $5 million is a 60% LTV loan. Commercial lenders typically limit LTV to:</p><ul><li>Multifamily (agency): up to 80%</li><li>Multifamily (bank/life company): 70-75%</li><li>Retail, industrial, office: 65-75%</li><li>Hospitality: 60-65%</li><li>Construction: 60-70% of total project cost</li></ul><p>The appraisal is commissioned by the lender (though paid for by the borrower) and will be based on comparable sales, income capitalization, and replacement cost approaches. Do not assume the purchase price equals appraised value — if you are buying below market or in a distressed situation, appraisals can come in above or below contract price.</p><h3>3. Borrower Net Worth and Liquidity</h3><p>Commercial lenders want to know that if the property encounters difficulty, the borrower has the resources to support it. Standard requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Net worth:</strong> Typically at least equal to the loan amount (some lenders require 1.0x-1.5x)</li><li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Post-closing liquid reserves of 6-12 months of debt service (typically 5-10% of loan amount in cash or liquid assets)</li><li><strong>Global DSCR:</strong> All income sources — property and personal — relative to all debt obligations</li></ul><p>These requirements are verified through a Personal Financial Statement (PFS), bank statements (last 3-6 months), and personal tax returns (last 2-3 years).</p><h3>4. Sponsorship Experience</h3><p>Lenders assess the borrower's track record with similar properties. A first-time investor seeking a $10 million multifamily loan will face more scrutiny than an experienced operator with a proven portfolio. Relevant experience includes:</p><ul><li>Number and size of prior commercial transactions</li><li>History of successful exits, refinancings, or portfolio growth</li><li>Property management experience or access to professional management</li><li>Industry relationships (tenants, operators, contractors)</li></ul><p>First-time commercial investors can improve their qualification odds by partnering with an experienced co-sponsor, hiring a professional property management company, or starting with smaller, simpler assets to build a track record.</p><h3>5. Credit and Entity Structure</h3><p>While commercial loans focus more on the property than personal credit, your credit history still matters:</p><ul><li><strong>Personal credit:</strong> Most lenders require a minimum 660-680 FICO score; 700+ is preferred</li><li><strong>No recent bankruptcies:</strong> Most lenders require 5-7 years clean history post-bankruptcy</li><li><strong>No recent foreclosures:</strong> Prior commercial foreclosures are major red flags</li><li><strong>Entity structure:</strong> Loans are typically made to an LLC or LP, not the individual. Have your entity properly structured before approaching lenders</li></ul><h2>How Lenders Differ in Their Requirements</h2><p>Not all lenders are created equal, and qualification requirements vary significantly:</p><ul><li><strong>Banks:</strong> Moderate DSCR (1.20x-1.30x), recourse typically required, community relationship valued</li><li><strong>Life insurance companies:</strong> Conservative LTV (55-65%), high DSCR (1.35x-1.50x), non-recourse above $5M, prefer pristine assets</li><li><strong>Agency (Fannie/Freddie):</strong> Multifamily only, generous LTV (up to 80%), competitive DSCR requirements, standardized process</li><li><strong>CMBS:</strong> Non-recourse, LTV up to 75%, nationwide, less sensitive to borrower net worth</li><li><strong>Bridge/debt funds:</strong> More flexible underwriting, focus on asset value and exit strategy, higher rates compensate for higher risk</li><li><strong>SBA:</strong> Lower down payment (10%), personal guarantee required, business occupancy requirement</li></ul><h2>Common Reasons Commercial Loans Are Declined</h2><ul><li>DSCR below 1.20x — the property's income does not support the requested loan amount</li><li>LTV above lender's threshold — purchase price or appraised value does not support the loan</li><li>Insufficient liquidity — borrower lacks post-closing reserves</li><li>Weak or no sponsorship experience for the asset type</li><li>Incomplete or inaccurate financial documentation</li><li>Property condition issues identified in the appraisal or property condition report</li><li>Environmental concerns from the Phase I report</li></ul><h2>How to Maximize Your Qualification Chances</h2><p>Work with a commercial mortgage broker before approaching lenders. An experienced broker pre-underwrites your deal, identifies issues before submission, and matches your specific profile to the most receptive lenders. At CLS CRE, we regularly help clients structure their deals — improving DSCR, optimizing entity structures, identifying the right capital source — before a single application is submitted. This preparation is the difference between a 60-day close and a 120-day process full of surprises.</p>
