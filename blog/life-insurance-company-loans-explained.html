      <p>Ask any experienced commercial real estate professional about the best lending terms in the market, and they'll point you to one source: life insurance companies. These institutional lenders consistently offer the lowest rates, longest terms, and most borrower-friendly structures available. Yet many borrowers never access this capital because they don't know it exists or don't have the relationships to reach it.</p><h2>Why Life Companies Lend on Real Estate</h2><p>Life insurance companies have a unique investment mandate that makes them ideal CRE lenders. Their policyholders pay premiums today that fund obligations decades in the future. This creates a need for long-duration, predictable income streams — which is exactly what commercial mortgages provide.</p><p>Unlike banks (which fund loans with short-term deposits) or debt funds (which use warehouse lines), life companies match their long-dated liabilities with long-dated assets. This means they can offer genuinely long-term fixed rates without the interest rate risk that constrains other lenders.</p><h2>What Makes Life Company Loans Different</h2><p><strong>Lowest rates in the market:</strong> Life companies typically price 25-75 basis points below banks and 50-150 basis points below CMBS for comparable deals. In early 2026, life company rates for top-quality assets are 5.25%-5.75%.</p><p><strong>Long fixed-rate terms:</strong> While banks typically cap fixed rates at 5-7 years, life companies routinely offer 10, 15, 20, and even 30-year fixed rates. This long-term rate certainty is invaluable for investors planning extended holds.</p><p><strong>Flexible prepayment:</strong> Many life companies offer declining prepayment penalties or even open prepayment windows, unlike the rigid yield maintenance or defeasance required by CMBS lenders.</p><p><strong>Relationship-oriented:</strong> Life companies value repeat borrowers and long-term relationships. Once you've established a track record with a life company lender, subsequent deals often receive preferential treatment and streamlined underwriting.</p><p><strong>Non-recourse:</strong> Most life company loans over $5 million are non-recourse (with standard carve-out guarantees), meaning the borrower's personal assets are protected.</p><h2>What Life Companies Look For</h2><p>Life companies are selective lenders. They focus on:</p><ul><li><strong>Low leverage:</strong> Typically 50-65% LTV, though some will stretch to 70% for premium assets</li><li><strong>Stabilized properties:</strong> 90%+ occupancy with proven cash flow</li><li><strong>Strong locations:</strong> Primary and secondary markets with diversified economies</li><li><strong>Quality assets:</strong> Well-maintained properties with institutional-quality tenants</li><li><strong>Experienced sponsors:</strong> Borrowers with a track record of successful ownership</li></ul><p>They generally avoid: high-leverage deals, transitional assets, tertiary markets, and heavy value-add strategies. If your deal doesn't fit, don't force it — a bank or debt fund may be a better match.</p><h2>Property Types Life Companies Prefer</h2><p>In order of preference:</p><ol><li><strong>Multifamily:</strong> The most popular asset class for life companies, especially garden-style and mid-rise in growth markets</li><li><strong>Industrial:</strong> Logistics, warehouse, and distribution centers with credit tenants</li><li><strong>Retail:</strong> Grocery-anchored centers and essential retail with strong traffic</li><li><strong>Office:</strong> Selective — primarily Class A in top markets with strong tenant credit</li><li><strong>Mixed-Use:</strong> Urban mixed-use with strong residential component</li></ol><h2>How to Access Life Company Capital</h2><p>Here's the challenge: life insurance companies don't advertise their lending programs. They don't have branches you can walk into. Most don't have websites with loan applications. Their correspondent (sales) teams cover large territories and focus on institutional relationships.</p><p>This is where a commercial mortgage broker with established life company relationships becomes essential. At CLS CRE, we maintain active relationships with 30+ life insurance company lenders, including:</p><ul><li>Metropolitan Life (MetLife)</li><li>Prudential Financial</li><li>New York Life</li><li>Northwestern Mutual</li><li>Principal Financial</li><li>Pacific Life</li><li>Unum Group</li><li>Lincoln Financial</li><li>Nationwide</li><li>Allstate Investments</li></ul><p>When you work with us, your deal is presented to every relevant life company simultaneously, creating competition that drives down your rate and improves your terms.</p><h2>Life Company Loan Sizing</h2><p>Life companies typically have minimum loan amounts of $2-5 million, with sweet spots in the $5-50 million range. Some larger companies will do loans up to $200+ million for trophy assets. The key metrics they use to size loans:</p><ul><li><strong>LTV:</strong> Maximum 65% for most deals</li><li><strong>DSCR:</strong> Minimum 1.30x-1.50x (higher than bank or CMBS requirements)</li><li><strong>Debt yield:</strong> Minimum 8-10% (net operating income divided by loan amount)</li></ul><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>If you own a stabilized commercial property worth $3 million or more, you should be exploring life insurance company financing. The rate savings over the life of a 10-year loan can be hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to alternatives. The challenge is accessing these lenders — which is exactly what CLS CRE specializes in.</p>
