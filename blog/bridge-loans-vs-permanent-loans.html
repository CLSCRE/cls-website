      <p>One of the most common questions we hear from commercial real estate investors is whether they should pursue bridge financing or a permanent loan. The answer depends on your property's current condition, your business plan, and your timeline. Here's a comprehensive breakdown to help you make the right choice.</p><h2>What Is a Permanent Loan?</h2><p>A permanent loan (also called a "perm" or "takeout" loan) is long-term financing for stabilized commercial properties. These loans typically feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Terms:</strong> 5-30 years, with 25-30 year amortization</li><li><strong>Rates:</strong> Fixed rates of 5.25%-6.75%, or floating at SOFR + 150-250 bps</li><li><strong>LTV:</strong> Up to 75-80% for multifamily (agency), 65-75% for commercial</li><li><strong>Lenders:</strong> Banks, life insurance companies, CMBS, Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac</li></ul><p>Permanent loans are the gold standard for stabilized, income-producing properties. They offer the lowest rates, longest terms, and most favorable structures. The trade-off is that lenders require the property to be performing — typically 90%+ occupied with stable cash flow and a minimum debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.20x-1.25x.</p><h2>What Is a Bridge Loan?</h2><p>A bridge loan is short-term financing designed to "bridge" the gap between acquisition (or a current state) and stabilization. Key characteristics include:</p><ul><li><strong>Terms:</strong> 12-36 months, typically interest-only</li><li><strong>Rates:</strong> SOFR + 250-450 bps (7.50%-9.50% all-in)</li><li><strong>LTV:</strong> Up to 75-80% of purchase price, sometimes 80-90% of cost with rehab budget</li><li><strong>Lenders:</strong> Debt funds, private lenders, some banks</li></ul><p>Bridge loans are built for properties in transition — value-add renovations, lease-up situations, repositioning, or properties that don't yet qualify for permanent financing. They're more expensive but far more flexible.</p><h2>When to Use a Permanent Loan</h2><p>A permanent loan is the right choice when:</p><ul><li>Your property is stabilized at 90%+ occupancy</li><li>Cash flow comfortably covers debt service (DSCR above 1.25x)</li><li>You plan to hold the property long-term (5+ years)</li><li>You want to lock in the lowest possible rate</li><li>The property doesn't need significant capital improvements</li><li>You're refinancing out of a bridge or construction loan after stabilization</li></ul><h2>When to Use a Bridge Loan</h2><p>A bridge loan makes more sense when:</p><ul><li>The property is below 85% occupancy or has significant vacancy</li><li>You're planning renovations or capital improvements</li><li>You're acquiring a distressed or mismanaged asset</li><li>The property needs lease-up time to reach stabilization</li><li>You have a 12-36 month business plan to add value</li><li>You need to close quickly (bridge loans can close in 2-4 weeks vs. 60-90 days for permanent)</li><li>The property has deferred maintenance or operational issues a permanent lender won't look past</li></ul><h2>The Bridge-to-Perm Strategy</h2><p>Many sophisticated investors use a two-step approach: acquire with a bridge loan, execute the business plan, then refinance into permanent financing once the property is stabilized. This strategy allows you to:</p><ol><li>Move quickly on acquisitions where seller timelines are tight</li><li>Finance the renovation or lease-up period with interest-only payments</li><li>Qualify for better permanent loan terms once the property is performing</li><li>Potentially pull cash out during the permanent refinance to recoup equity</li></ol><p>The key risk in this strategy is execution. If your renovation takes longer than expected or the market shifts, extending a bridge loan can be costly. Budget conservatively and build in a 6-month cushion on your bridge term.</p><h2>Cost Comparison Example</h2><p>Consider a $5 million multifamily acquisition:</p><p><strong>Permanent Loan:</strong> 70% LTV ($3.5M loan), 5.75% fixed, 30-year amortization = $20,400/month payment. Total interest over 5 years: ~$952,000.</p><p><strong>Bridge Loan:</strong> 75% LTV ($3.75M loan), 8.5% interest-only for 24 months = $26,563/month. Total interest over 2 years: ~$637,500. Then refinance to permanent.</p><p>While the bridge rate is higher, the interest-only structure and shorter hold period can actually result in less total interest paid — provided you execute the business plan on schedule.</p><h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2><p>The right choice comes down to property condition and business plan. If your property is stabilized and you're looking for long-term hold, go permanent. If you're adding value and need flexibility, bridge first, then refinance.</p><p>In either case, having a broker who understands both sides of the capital stack — and knows which lenders are most competitive for your specific scenario — is critical to getting the best terms. At CLS CRE, we regularly structure both bridge and permanent loans, and we often plan the exit strategy (permanent takeout) before closing the bridge.</p>
