      <p>Closing a commercial real estate loan is significantly more complex than a residential mortgage. Multiple parties, extensive documentation, and detailed due diligence all need to come together on a tight timeline. Being prepared from the start can mean the difference between closing on schedule and costly delays.</p><h2>Pre-Application Preparation</h2><p>Before you even approach a lender, have these items ready:</p><ul><li><strong>Current rent roll:</strong> Unit-by-unit or tenant-by-tenant with lease dates, rates, and terms</li><li><strong>Trailing 12-month operating statements (T-12):</strong> Monthly income and expense detail</li><li><strong>Last 3 years of operating statements:</strong> Annual income/expense with year-over-year trends</li><li><strong>Personal financial statement (PFS):</strong> Net worth, liquidity, assets, and liabilities for all guarantors</li><li><strong>3 years of personal and business tax returns:</strong> For all sponsors/guarantors</li><li><strong>Property photos:</strong> Exterior, interior, amenities, and any capital improvements</li><li><strong>Business plan:</strong> Your strategy for the property (hold, value-add, development)</li></ul><h2>Loan Application Phase</h2><p>Once you've selected a lender and received a term sheet, you'll need to provide:</p><ul><li><strong>Signed term sheet or letter of intent:</strong> Your acceptance of the proposed terms</li><li><strong>Good faith deposit:</strong> Typically $10,000-$50,000 for third-party reports</li><li><strong>Entity documents:</strong> Operating agreement, articles of organization, EIN letter</li><li><strong>Purchase contract:</strong> For acquisitions, the fully executed PSA</li><li><strong>Insurance information:</strong> Current policy or proof of insurability</li></ul><h2>Due Diligence &amp; Third-Party Reports</h2><p>The lender will order several third-party reports, typically at the borrower's expense:</p><ul><li><strong>Appraisal:</strong> Independent valuation of the property ($3,000-$15,000+, 3-5 weeks)</li><li><strong>Environmental Phase I:</strong> Assessment of environmental contamination risk ($2,500-$5,000, 3-4 weeks)</li><li><strong>Property Condition Assessment (PCA):</strong> Engineering report on building condition ($3,000-$8,000, 2-3 weeks)</li><li><strong>Survey:</strong> ALTA/NSPS land title survey ($3,000-$10,000, 2-4 weeks)</li><li><strong>Title search and title insurance:</strong> Confirms clear title and insures against defects</li><li><strong>Seismic report:</strong> Required in earthquake-prone areas (California, Pacific Northwest)</li><li><strong>Zoning report:</strong> Confirms the property's use conforms to local zoning</li></ul><p>These reports are the most common source of closing delays. Order them immediately after signing the term sheet to give them maximum time to complete.</p><h2>Underwriting &amp; Approval</h2><p>During underwriting, be prepared to respond quickly to lender requests for:</p><ul><li>Clarification on operating statement line items</li><li>Additional lease documents (amendments, estoppels, SNDAs)</li><li>Explanation of any deferred maintenance or capital needs</li><li>Updated financial statements if more than 90 days old</li><li>Market data supporting your pro forma assumptions</li></ul><p>Responsiveness during underwriting is critical. Every day of delay in providing information is a day added to your closing timeline.</p><h2>Pre-Closing Requirements</h2><p>In the weeks before closing, you'll need to finalize:</p><ul><li><strong>Insurance binder:</strong> Proof of property insurance meeting lender requirements (liability limits, named insured, loss payee)</li><li><strong>Entity formation:</strong> Single-purpose entity (SPE) if required by the lender</li><li><strong>Legal review:</strong> Attorney review of loan documents (allow 1-2 weeks)</li><li><strong>Tenant estoppel certificates:</strong> Signed statements from tenants confirming lease terms</li><li><strong>Subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreements (SNDAs):</strong> For major tenants</li><li><strong>Reserves:</strong> Tax escrow, insurance escrow, replacement reserves, and any required holdbacks</li><li><strong>Good funds:</strong> Wire equity and closing costs to the title company or closing attorney</li></ul><h2>Closing Day</h2><p>On closing day, expect to sign:</p><ul><li>Promissory note</li><li>Mortgage/deed of trust</li><li>Loan agreement</li><li>Environmental indemnity</li><li>Guaranty agreement (if recourse or carve-out guaranty)</li><li>Assignment of leases and rents</li><li>UCC financing statements</li><li>Closing statement</li></ul><p>Most commercial closings happen via email/courier with a closing escrow agent coordinating signatures and funds. In-person closings are rare.</p><h2>Common Reasons for Closing Delays</h2><ol><li><strong>Appraisal comes in low:</strong> If the appraised value is below expectations, the loan amount may need to be reduced or the deal renegotiated.</li><li><strong>Environmental issues:</strong> Phase I findings that require a Phase II investigation can add 4-8 weeks.</li><li><strong>Title defects:</strong> Liens, easements, or encroachments that need to be resolved.</li><li><strong>Slow tenant estoppels:</strong> Tenants who don't return estoppel certificates on time.</li><li><strong>Insurance requirements:</strong> Meeting specific lender insurance requirements (flood, earthquake, wind) can take time.</li></ol><h2>How a Broker Helps</h2><p>An experienced CRE mortgage broker manages the entire closing process — coordinating between borrower, lender, title company, appraiser, and attorneys. We anticipate issues before they become problems and keep the process moving on schedule. At CLS CRE, we've closed hundreds of commercial loans and know exactly what each lender requires to get to the closing table on time.</p>
