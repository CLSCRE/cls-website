      <p>Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities — commonly called CMBS or conduit loans — are one of the most misunderstood financing tools in commercial real estate. Mention them in a room of investors and you'll get reactions ranging from enthusiasm to fear. The truth is somewhere in between: CMBS loans are a powerful capital source with specific advantages and limitations that every CRE investor should understand.</p><h2>What Is a CMBS Loan?</h2><p>A CMBS loan is a commercial mortgage that, after origination, is pooled with dozens of other mortgages and sold to investors as bonds on the secondary market. The lender — typically a large bank or conduit lender — originates the loan, earns an origination fee, and then sells it off their balance sheet. From that point forward, a loan servicer manages the loan on behalf of the bondholders.</p><p>This securitization model allows lenders to recycle capital and originate more loans than they could hold on their own balance sheets, which means more available capital for borrowers. The CMBS market currently provides over $600 billion in outstanding commercial real estate debt.</p><h2>How CMBS Loans Work</h2><p>The origination process looks similar to a conventional commercial mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Application and underwriting:</strong> The conduit lender evaluates the property, borrower, and market fundamentals.</li><li><strong>Term sheet and commitment:</strong> If approved, you receive a term sheet outlining rate, LTV, DSCR requirements, and structure.</li><li><strong>Closing:</strong> The loan closes like a conventional mortgage, with title, appraisal, environmental, and legal work.</li><li><strong>Securitization:</strong> Within 60-90 days of closing, the lender pools your loan with others and sells bonds backed by the pool to institutional investors.</li><li><strong>Servicing transfer:</strong> Loan servicing transfers to a master servicer, and a special servicer stands by for any defaults or modifications.</li></ol><h2>Key CMBS Loan Terms</h2><p><strong>Loan size:</strong> Most CMBS lenders have minimums of $2-5 million, with the sweet spot between $5 million and $100 million. Some conduit programs originate well above that for trophy assets.</p><p><strong>LTV:</strong> Up to 75% for most property types; 65-70% for office and hospitality.</p><p><strong>Rates:</strong> Fixed rates in the 5.50%-6.75% range in early 2026, depending on property type and leverage. CMBS rates price off the swap rate rather than Treasuries, so they can sometimes be more attractive than bank alternatives.</p><p><strong>Terms:</strong> Typically 5, 7, or 10 years with 25-30 year amortization, or interest-only for strong deals.</p><p><strong>DSCR:</strong> Minimum 1.20x-1.25x based on lender underwriting of actual in-place cash flow.</p><p><strong>Non-recourse:</strong> CMBS loans are almost always non-recourse with standard bad-boy carve-outs, making them attractive for borrowers who want to protect personal assets.</p><h2>Where CMBS Loans Shine</h2><p>CMBS is often the best — or only — option in several scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>Larger loans:</strong> Banks often have concentration limits. CMBS lenders have no such constraint and will write large single-asset loans without hesitation.</li><li><strong>Tertiary markets:</strong> Life companies and banks often avoid smaller markets. CMBS lenders will lend nationwide if the property fundamentals support it.</li><li><strong>Non-traditional property types:</strong> Hotels, self-storage, manufactured housing, and mixed-use properties that banks approach cautiously are often financed efficiently via CMBS.</li><li><strong>High-leverage interest-only:</strong> CMBS can provide full-term interest-only on strong deals, maximizing cash-on-cash returns during the hold period.</li><li><strong>Cash-out refinances:</strong> CMBS lenders will pull equity out of stabilized assets at high LTVs, useful for portfolio recycling and capital deployment.</li></ul><h2>The CMBS Trade-Off: Prepayment Penalties</h2><p>The biggest drawback of CMBS loans is prepayment inflexibility. Because the loan has been securitized and sold to bondholders counting on the interest stream, CMBS loans carry rigid prepayment structures:</p><p><strong>Yield maintenance:</strong> A penalty calculated to make the lender whole on all future interest payments, often very expensive in a declining rate environment.</p><p><strong>Defeasance:</strong> The borrower substitutes U.S. Treasury securities for the property collateral, continuing to service the debt without the real estate. This allows a property sale or refinance but requires purchasing a Treasury portfolio at prevailing prices.</p><p>Most CMBS loans have an open prepayment window in the final 3-6 months before maturity. Outside that window, early payoff is very expensive. CMBS is best for borrowers with long hold horizons who do not anticipate selling or refinancing before maturity.</p><h2>CMBS vs. Bank vs. Life Company: Quick Comparison</h2><p><strong>Rate:</strong> Life company typically lowest; bank mid-range; CMBS varies but competitive for larger deals.</p><p><strong>Leverage:</strong> CMBS and bank can reach 75%; life company usually caps at 65%.</p><p><strong>Non-recourse:</strong> CMBS almost always; life company usually above $5M; bank often requires recourse.</p><p><strong>Prepayment:</strong> Life company most flexible; bank moderate; CMBS most restrictive.</p><p><strong>Geographic coverage:</strong> CMBS is truly national; life companies focus on primary and secondary markets; banks concentrate near their branches.</p><h2>Working With a CMBS Broker</h2><p>Access to the CMBS market requires knowing which conduit lenders are most competitive for your property type and geography. Lender appetite shifts frequently based on the composition of their current securitization pool. At CLS CRE, we maintain active relationships with 20+ conduit lenders and monitor their current programs daily. If your deal fits a lender's current appetite, we know it immediately and can move fast to lock a rate.</p><p>If you own a stabilized asset above $3 million and need competitive fixed-rate financing without recourse, a CMBS loan deserves serious consideration. Contact CLS CRE to run a side-by-side comparison of CMBS versus bank versus life company execution for your deal.</p>
