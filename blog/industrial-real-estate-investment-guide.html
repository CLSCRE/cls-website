      <p>If you've been watching commercial real estate markets over the past five years, one trend stands out above all others: the insatiable demand for industrial space. Warehouses, distribution centers, and logistics facilities have become the most sought-after assets in CRE, and the fundamentals supporting this demand show no signs of weakening in 2026.</p><h2>What's Driving Industrial Demand</h2><h3>E-Commerce Continues to Grow</h3><p>Online retail penetration continues to climb, now accounting for over 22% of total retail sales. Every $1 billion in e-commerce sales requires approximately 1.25 million square feet of warehouse space. Companies need more distribution centers, closer to population centers, to meet consumer expectations for fast delivery.</p><h3>Nearshoring and Supply Chain Reconfiguration</h3><p>The post-pandemic shift toward domestic and near-shore manufacturing has created massive demand for industrial space in the U.S. and Mexico. Companies that previously relied entirely on Asian supply chains are building redundancy through North American facilities. This trend has been accelerated by trade policy uncertainty and the desire for supply chain resilience.</p><h3>Last-Mile Logistics</h3><p>The "last-mile" revolution — getting products from distribution centers to customers' doors — has created demand for smaller industrial facilities in urban and suburban locations. These infill locations command premium rents and are difficult to replicate due to land constraints.</p><h3>Cold Storage and Specialized Facilities</h3><p>The growth of online grocery and meal delivery services has driven demand for temperature-controlled warehouse space. Cold storage construction costs are 2-3x conventional warehouse costs, creating high barriers to entry and supporting premium rents for existing facilities.</p><h2>Industrial Market Fundamentals</h2><p>The numbers tell a compelling story:</p><ul><li><strong>National vacancy:</strong> 5.8% — historically tight despite record new construction</li><li><strong>Rent growth:</strong> 4-6% year-over-year in top markets, outpacing inflation</li><li><strong>New supply:</strong> Slowing significantly as developers pull back from 2022-2023 construction highs</li><li><strong>Net absorption:</strong> Remains positive as tenants continue to expand their logistics footprints</li><li><strong>Cap rates:</strong> 5.25%-6.50% for Class A, 6.00%-7.50% for Class B/C value-add</li></ul><h2>Top Industrial Markets</h2><p><strong>Inland Empire, CA:</strong> The nation's largest distribution hub, benefiting from proximity to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Vacancy is among the lowest in the country at under 4%.</p><p><strong>Dallas-Fort Worth, TX:</strong> Centrally located with excellent highway and rail infrastructure. DFW is a top choice for national distribution strategies.</p><p><strong>Phoenix, AZ:</strong> Benefiting from California spillover, TSMC semiconductor manufacturing, and I-10 corridor logistics. The market has seen explosive growth in both big-box and manufacturing space.</p><p><strong>Atlanta, GA:</strong> A Southeast logistics powerhouse with Hartsfield-Jackson Airport (the world's busiest) and extensive rail connectivity.</p><p><strong>Chicago, IL:</strong> The Midwest's distribution hub, with the largest intermodal facility network in the country.</p><h2>Financing Industrial Properties</h2><p>Industrial properties enjoy the most favorable financing terms of any CRE asset class alongside multifamily. Here's what's available:</p><p><strong>Permanent loans (stabilized):</strong> 5.25%-6.25% fixed rates, up to 75% LTV, 25-year amortization. Life companies and banks are competing aggressively for industrial paper.</p><p><strong>Bridge loans (value-add):</strong> SOFR + 250-400 bps for properties requiring lease-up, renovation, or repositioning. Bridge lenders love industrial because of strong market fundamentals.</p><p><strong>Construction loans:</strong> SOFR + 300-450 bps for speculative and build-to-suit industrial development. Pre-leasing requirements have been reduced as lender confidence in the sector grows.</p><h2>Investment Strategies</h2><p><strong>Core/Core-Plus:</strong> Acquire stabilized, well-located industrial assets with long-term credit tenants. These offer stable cash flow and modest appreciation, financed with low-cost permanent debt.</p><p><strong>Value-Add:</strong> Acquire older Class B/C industrial properties, invest in facility improvements (loading docks, clear height, lighting, HVAC), and re-lease at higher rents. This strategy has generated strong returns in markets with tight vacancy.</p><p><strong>Development:</strong> Build new Class A speculative or build-to-suit industrial facilities. Returns are highest here, but so is the risk. Successful developers focus on infill locations with high barriers to entry.</p><p><strong>Last-Mile:</strong> Target smaller (25,000-100,000 SF) facilities in urban/suburban locations near population centers. These assets are irreplaceable and command premium rents.</p><h2>The CLS CRE Advantage</h2><p>We've financed industrial properties across every major market in the United States, from single-tenant warehouse acquisitions to multi-building logistics portfolios. Our lender relationships include institutional capital sources that specialize in industrial lending, ensuring our clients get the most competitive terms available.</p>
