      <p>Multifamily continues to be the most favored commercial real estate asset class among lenders and investors alike. With favorable demographics, strong rental demand, and the most competitive financing options available, apartments remain the cornerstone of many CRE portfolios. But not all markets are created equal. Here are the five markets we're watching most closely for multifamily investment in 2026.</p><h2>1. Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas</h2><p>DFW continues to dominate as a multifamily investment destination. The metro added over 150,000 jobs in the past year, and population growth shows no signs of slowing as corporate relocations bring major employers to the region.</p><p><strong>Key metrics:</strong></p><ul><li>Rent growth: 3.5-4.5% year-over-year</li><li>Vacancy: 6.2% (down from 2024 highs as new supply is absorbed)</li><li>Cap rates: 5.25%-5.75% for Class B/C value-add</li><li>Financing: Agency debt widely available at 5.25%-5.75%</li></ul><p>The supply wave that concerned investors in 2024 is being absorbed faster than expected, and new construction starts have slowed meaningfully. This sets up well for rent growth acceleration in the second half of 2026.</p><h2>2. Phoenix, Arizona</h2><p>Phoenix's story is one of maturation. The metro has evolved from a pure growth play to a diversified economy anchored by semiconductor manufacturing (TSMC), healthcare, and financial services. The city's affordability advantage relative to California continues to drive inbound migration.</p><p><strong>Key metrics:</strong></p><ul><li>Rent growth: 4.0-5.0% year-over-year</li><li>Vacancy: 5.8%</li><li>Cap rates: 5.00%-5.50% for Class B/C value-add</li><li>Financing: Strong lender appetite across all capital sources</li></ul><p>We're particularly bullish on the Southeast Valley (Gilbert, Chandler, Mesa) where TSMC-driven employment is creating outsized housing demand.</p><h2>3. Atlanta, Georgia</h2><p>Atlanta offers the combination of strong job growth, relative affordability, and a deep pool of renters. The metro's diversified economy — spanning logistics, healthcare, technology, and film production — provides resilience against sector-specific downturns.</p><p><strong>Key metrics:</strong></p><ul><li>Rent growth: 3.0-4.0% year-over-year</li><li>Vacancy: 6.5%</li><li>Cap rates: 5.50%-6.00% for Class B/C value-add</li><li>Financing: Excellent agency and bank availability</li></ul><p>The Beltline corridor and midtown submarkets continue to see the strongest fundamentals, while suburban workforce housing offers the best risk-adjusted returns.</p><h2>4. Nashville, Tennessee</h2><p>Nashville has emerged as one of the most dynamic metros in the Southeast, with robust job creation in healthcare, technology, and entertainment. The city's quality of life and lack of state income tax continue to attract both employers and young professionals.</p><p><strong>Key metrics:</strong></p><ul><li>Rent growth: 3.5-4.5% year-over-year</li><li>Vacancy: 5.5%</li><li>Cap rates: 5.25%-5.75% for Class B/C value-add</li><li>Financing: Growing lender appetite as the market matures</li></ul><p>The key watch item in Nashville is supply — the metro has been a magnet for new construction. However, the pipeline is moderating, and absorption has been strong.</p><h2>5. Tampa-St. Petersburg, Florida</h2><p>Tampa Bay combines Florida's tax advantages and lifestyle appeal with a growing employment base. The metro has benefited from financial services growth, healthcare expansion, and the broader Florida migration trend.</p><p><strong>Key metrics:</strong></p><ul><li>Rent growth: 3.0-4.0% year-over-year</li><li>Vacancy: 6.0%</li><li>Cap rates: 5.50%-6.00% for Class B/C value-add</li><li>Financing: Active agency and CMBS market</li></ul><p>Insurance costs remain a consideration for Tampa Bay multifamily, but the fundamentals are strong enough to absorb the added expense. Look for value-add opportunities in Class B suburban product where the basis is low enough to accommodate elevated insurance.</p><h2>What These Markets Have in Common</h2><p>The best multifamily markets in 2026 share several characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Job growth above the national average</strong> — Employment drives housing demand</li><li><strong>Net positive migration</strong> — People moving in faster than moving out</li><li><strong>Moderating new supply</strong> — Construction starts have slowed, tightening the market</li><li><strong>Affordability</strong> — Rent-to-income ratios that support further rent growth</li><li><strong>Lender appetite</strong> — Active financing markets with competitive terms</li></ul><h2>Financing Multifamily Acquisitions</h2><p>Multifamily remains the easiest commercial property type to finance. Agency lenders (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) provide the most competitive terms for stabilized assets, while bridge lenders and debt funds are active for value-add plays. The key is matching the right capital source to your specific business plan — a bridge-to-agency strategy for value-add, or direct agency/life company for stabilized acquisitions.</p><p>At CLS CRE, we close multifamily transactions across all five of these markets and dozens more. Our 1,000+ lender relationships ensure you're seeing the most competitive terms available for your specific deal.</p>
