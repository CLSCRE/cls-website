      <p>Ground-up commercial construction is one of the most capital-intensive activities in real estate. Unlike acquiring a stabilized building, construction financing requires specialized loan structures, rigorous underwriting, and a different set of lender relationships. Here's a comprehensive guide to how it works.</p><h2>What Is a Construction Loan?</h2><p>A construction loan is a short-term financing facility that funds the building of a new commercial property. Unlike a permanent loan that's disbursed in full at closing, a construction loan is drawn down in stages as construction progresses. Key characteristics include:</p><ul><li><strong>Term:</strong> 12-36 months (aligned with construction timeline)</li><li><strong>Rate:</strong> Floating, typically SOFR + 300-500 basis points</li><li><strong>LTC:</strong> 55-75% of total project cost</li><li><strong>Disbursement:</strong> Monthly draws based on completed work</li><li><strong>Interest:</strong> Paid only on the amount drawn (not the full commitment)</li></ul><h2>The Construction Loan Process</h2><h3>Step 1: Pre-Development</h3><p>Before approaching lenders, you need:</p><ul><li><strong>Entitled land or purchase contract:</strong> Zoning, permits, and environmental clearance</li><li><strong>Architectural plans:</strong> Complete construction documents</li><li><strong>General contractor:</strong> Licensed GC with a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contract</li><li><strong>Pro forma:</strong> Detailed budget and projected returns</li><li><strong>Pre-leasing (for commercial):</strong> Many lenders want 30-50% pre-leased before funding</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Loan Application &amp; Underwriting</h3><p>Construction loan underwriting is more intensive than permanent financing. Lenders evaluate:</p><ul><li><strong>Sponsor experience:</strong> Your track record with similar projects</li><li><strong>Project feasibility:</strong> Market demand, comparable rents, absorption timeline</li><li><strong>Budget review:</strong> Line-by-line cost analysis, often verified by a third-party cost consultant</li><li><strong>Contractor qualification:</strong> GC financial strength, bonding capacity, track record</li><li><strong>Exit strategy:</strong> How you'll repay — permanent takeout, sale, or refinance</li></ul><h3>Step 3: Loan Closing</h3><p>At closing, the lender establishes the loan facility but doesn't fund the full amount. You'll typically need to contribute your equity first (the "equity-in-first" requirement). The loan documents will include a detailed draw schedule, construction timeline, and milestone requirements.</p><h3>Step 4: Draw Process</h3><p>This is where construction loans differ most from other financing. Each month during construction:</p><ol><li>The GC submits a draw request detailing work completed</li><li>The lender's inspector verifies the work on-site</li><li>The lender approves and funds the draw (typically within 5-10 business days)</li><li>You use the funds to pay the contractor and subs</li></ol><p>Interest accrues only on the amount drawn, so your carrying cost increases as construction progresses. Most construction loans include an interest reserve — a budgeted amount within the loan to cover interest payments during construction.</p><h3>Step 5: Completion &amp; Takeout</h3><p>Once construction is complete and you receive a certificate of occupancy (CO), you'll need to execute your exit strategy. For most projects, this means:</p><ul><li><strong>Lease-up period:</strong> Fill the building to stabilization (usually 6-12 months post-CO)</li><li><strong>Permanent refinance:</strong> Replace the construction loan with long-term permanent financing</li><li><strong>Sale:</strong> Sell the completed project to a long-term holder</li></ul><p>Many construction loans include a "mini-perm" feature — an automatic conversion to a short-term permanent loan at maturity, giving you additional time to stabilize and arrange takeout financing.</p><h2>Key Construction Loan Terms to Know</h2><p><strong>Loan-to-Cost (LTC):</strong> The percentage of total project cost the lender will finance. Typically 55-75% for commercial construction.</p><p><strong>Loan-to-Value (LTV):</strong> The loan amount as a percentage of the projected completed value. Usually capped at 70-75%.</p><p><strong>Interest Reserve:</strong> Money budgeted within the loan to make interest payments during construction, so you don't need to fund them out of pocket.</p><p><strong>Retainage:</strong> A percentage (usually 5-10%) of each draw that's held back until construction is complete, ensuring the contractor finishes the job.</p><p><strong>Completion Guarantee:</strong> A personal guarantee that the project will be completed on budget. Most construction lenders require this from the sponsor.</p><h2>Tips for Getting the Best Construction Loan</h2><ol><li><strong>Build your track record:</strong> Lenders heavily weight sponsor experience. If you're a first-time developer, partner with an experienced developer or GC.</li><li><strong>Get pre-leasing:</strong> Nothing de-risks a project for a lender like signed leases. Even LOIs can help.</li><li><strong>Use a reputable GC:</strong> A well-known general contractor with bonding capacity makes lenders more comfortable.</li><li><strong>Budget conservatively:</strong> Include 5-10% hard cost contingency and 3-6% soft cost contingency.</li><li><strong>Plan your exit:</strong> Have the permanent takeout lined up, or at least identified, before you start construction.</li></ol><p>At CLS CRE, we structure construction loans for projects ranging from $2 million to $100+ million across all property types. Our lender relationships span banks, credit unions, life companies, and private capital sources that actively seek construction lending opportunities.</p>
