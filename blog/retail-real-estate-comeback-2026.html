      <p>Five years ago, every CRE conference featured at least one panel on the death of retail. The predictions were dire: e-commerce would hollow out brick-and-mortar retail, shopping malls would become vacant wastelands, and strip centers would convert to warehouses en masse. What actually happened tells a more nuanced and, for investors, more encouraging story.</p><h2>The Retail Reset: What Really Happened</h2><p>Yes, retail suffered. Department stores, specialty apparel, and discretionary retailers experienced massive bankruptcies and store closures during 2019-2021. But this pain was concentrated — it hit specific retail formats and tenants, while others thrived. The result was a dramatic culling of weak operators and an inadvertent reduction of retail supply just as demand patterns were shifting.</p><p>New retail construction collapsed during the same period. Between 2020 and 2023, virtually no new shopping centers were built. The industry delivered fewer square feet of new retail space than any comparable period in the past four decades. The combination of store closures (reducing demand) and zero new construction (eliminating supply) reset the market dynamics entirely.</p><h2>The New Retail Landscape in 2026</h2><p>The retail sector that emerged from this reset looks fundamentally different from 2019:</p><h3>Necessity Retail Is Thriving</h3><p>Grocery stores, pharmacies, discount retailers (TJX, Burlington, Five Below), dollar stores, and fast casual restaurants have never been stronger. These tenants offer something e-commerce cannot: immediacy, tangibility, and experience. National vacancy for grocery-anchored centers stands at a historically tight 4.5%, with rents growing 5-7% annually.</p><h3>Experiential Retail Is Expanding</h3><p>Fitness centers, entertainment concepts (Top Golf, Bowlero, Cinemark), medical/dental offices, and food halls have absorbed millions of square feet formerly occupied by struggling apparel tenants. These uses are inherently internet-proof — you cannot download a spin class or a dental cleaning.</p><h3>Omnichannel Integration</h3><p>Ironically, e-commerce has become a driver of physical retail demand. Click-and-collect, same-day delivery using stores as fulfillment hubs, and the recognition that online and physical retail are complementary (not competitive) has made strong physical locations more valuable, not less.</p><h3>Supply Constraint Is the Story</h3><p>With no new supply entering the market at meaningful scale, every vacancy created by a closed retailer is quickly absorbed by a stronger tenant — often at higher rents. The pipeline of new retail construction remains minimal in 2026, setting up continued rent growth for well-located existing centers.</p><h2>Retail Market Metrics: Early 2026</h2><ul><li><strong>National retail vacancy:</strong> 5.8% — the lowest since 2007</li><li><strong>Rent growth:</strong> 4.5%-6.5% year-over-year for necessity and service-oriented retail</li><li><strong>Net absorption:</strong> Consistently positive for the third consecutive year</li><li><strong>Cap rates, grocery-anchored:</strong> 5.75%-6.50%</li><li><strong>Cap rates, NNN single-tenant (investment grade):</strong> 5.00%-6.00%</li><li><strong>Cap rates, strip center, service-oriented:</strong> 6.50%-7.50%</li></ul><h2>Where the Opportunities Are</h2><h3>Grocery-Anchored Centers</h3><p>The gold standard of retail investment. Kroger, Publix, Whole Foods, Sprouts, and Aldi-anchored centers in growing suburban markets are commanding premium pricing — and justifiably so. These centers generate durable, growing cash flows with recession-resistant tenants. Financing is excellent, with life companies and banks actively competing for these assets.</p><h3>NNN Single-Tenant Retail</h3><p>Triple-net leases with investment-grade tenants (Dollar General, CVS, Starbucks, McDonald's, AutoZone) remain institutional-quality income streams. Cap rates have risen from the ultra-compressed 4.00%-4.50% of 2021-2022 to more rational 5.00%-6.00% levels, improving the risk-reward profile for buyers.</p><h3>Strip Centers: Repositioned and Reinvented</h3><p>Value-add strip centers — anchored by service retail rather than failed apparel — offer compelling returns. Look for centers with medical, food service, beauty, fitness, and essential service tenants that generate consistent foot traffic. These assets trade at 6.50%-7.50% caps with value-add upside from re-tenanting below-market leases.</p><h2>What About Malls?</h2><p>The mall story remains bifurcated. A-rated malls in dominant locations (the top 250 or so in the country) have successfully repositioned with luxury, entertainment, and experiential tenants and continue to generate strong performance. Class B and C malls face an existential challenge — many are being converted to mixed-use, logistics, or residential uses.</p><p>Our advice: avoid regional malls unless you have specific repositioning expertise and a clear path to alternative uses. The well-located experiential properties are worth a look at the right basis.</p><h2>Financing Retail in 2026</h2><p>Lender appetite for retail has improved meaningfully as the sector's fundamentals have recovered. Grocery-anchored centers and NNN retail now command competitive rates from banks and life companies. Strip centers with strong tenant rosters can access conventional bank financing at 65-70% LTV.</p><p>At CLS CRE, we have financed retail transactions across all formats — from single-tenant NNN acquisitions under $1 million to multi-property grocery-anchored portfolios. If retail is part of your investment strategy, the 2026 market deserves a fresh look.</p>
