Non-recourse financing typically carries higher interest rates (25-75 bps premium), lower leverage, and more restrictive covenants.

Non-recourse is most valuable when execution risk is meaningful and capping personal downside is the priority."}}]}

      <p>When negotiating a commercial real estate loan, few terms carry more personal and financial significance than whether the loan is recourse or non-recourse. The difference determines whether your personal assets — your home, savings, other investments — are at risk if the loan goes into default. Understanding this distinction, when each structure applies, and how to navigate the carve-outs that complicate the picture is essential for any CRE borrower.</p><h2>What Is a Recourse Loan?</h2><p>A recourse loan is a loan where the borrower (and typically the guarantor) is personally liable for repayment. If the property fails to generate enough value to repay the loan at maturity or foreclosure, the lender can pursue the borrower personally — seizing other assets, garnishing income, or obtaining a judgment — to recover the shortfall.</p><p>In commercial real estate, recourse loans are common for:</p><ul><li>Community and regional bank loans (most bank CRE loans are full recourse)</li><li>SBA 7(a) and 504 loans (always require personal guarantee)</li><li>Smaller loans under $1-3 million from most lenders</li><li>Construction loans (almost always recourse)</li><li>Bridge loans from smaller private lenders</li><li>Loans to borrowers with limited track records</li></ul><p>The personal guarantee on a recourse loan is not just a formality. In a default, lenders will exercise their rights against guarantors, and this has real financial consequences. The 2008-2012 downturn saw thousands of commercial real estate borrowers lose not just their properties but significant personal wealth through recourse liability.</p><h2>What Is a Non-Recourse Loan?</h2><p>A non-recourse loan limits the lender's remedies to the property itself. If the loan defaults and the property value is insufficient to repay the debt, the lender's loss is absorbed by the loan — the borrower walks away without personal liability (beyond losing the property and any equity invested).</p><p>Non-recourse loans are available from:</p><ul><li>Life insurance companies (typically for loans above $5 million)</li><li>CMBS/conduit lenders (virtually always non-recourse)</li><li>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (agency multifamily loans are non-recourse)</li><li>Many larger debt funds for bridge loans above $10 million</li></ul><h2>The Carve-Outs: When Non-Recourse Becomes Recourse</h2><p>Here is the most important concept every CRE borrower needs to understand: virtually no commercial real estate loan is truly non-recourse. All non-recourse loans include a set of carve-outs — specific bad acts that trigger personal liability even though the loan is nominally non-recourse. These are called "bad boy carve-outs" or "springing recourse" provisions.</p><h3>Standard Carve-Out Events (Partial Recourse)</h3><p>These trigger personal liability for specific losses or costs, not the full loan balance:</p><ul><li>Misrepresentation in the loan application or financial statements</li><li>Unauthorized transfer of the property</li><li>Waste or mismanagement of the property</li><li>Failure to maintain required insurance</li><li>Diversion of rental income (not paying operating expenses)</li><li>Environmental contamination</li></ul><h3>Full Recourse Trigger Events (Springing Recourse)</h3><p>These catastrophic events trigger full personal liability for the entire loan balance:</p><ul><li><strong>Voluntary bankruptcy filing:</strong> If you file for bankruptcy protection on the property, the non-recourse protection typically evaporates — a devastating surprise for borrowers who thought filing for bankruptcy was a safe harbor.</li><li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Any fraudulent act in connection with the loan</li><li><strong>Intentional destruction:</strong> Physical destruction of the collateral</li><li><strong>Criminal acts:</strong> Use of the property for criminal purposes</li></ul><p>The bankruptcy carve-out in particular has caught many borrowers by surprise. Consult experienced legal counsel before considering any bankruptcy filing on a property with a non-recourse loan.</p><h2>How Lenders Decide: Recourse vs. Non-Recourse</h2><p>The recourse/non-recourse decision is not arbitrary — it reflects risk allocation based on several factors:</p><p><strong>Loan size:</strong> Larger loans are more commonly non-recourse. Below $1-2 million, most lenders require recourse regardless of sponsor strength.</p><p><strong>Lender type:</strong> CMBS and life companies are almost always non-recourse. Banks are almost always recourse. This is structural and non-negotiable at most institutions.</p><p><strong>Sponsor strength:</strong> A borrower with a $50 million net worth and 20 years of successful CRE investment has more leverage to negotiate non-recourse terms than a first-time investor.</p><p><strong>Asset quality:</strong> Trophy assets in primary markets with institutional-quality tenants are more likely to support non-recourse financing. Value-add or transitional assets carry recourse more commonly.</p><p><strong>LTV:</strong> Lower leverage deals (under 60% LTV) are more likely to qualify for non-recourse. Higher leverage requires recourse to compensate for the lender's increased risk.</p><h2>Is Non-Recourse Always Better?</h2><p>Non-recourse is generally preferable from a risk management perspective, but it comes with trade-offs:</p><ul><li><strong>Higher rates:</strong> Non-recourse typically carries a 25-75 basis point rate premium over recourse financing</li><li><strong>Lower leverage:</strong> Non-recourse lenders are typically more conservative on LTV</li><li><strong>More restrictive covenants:</strong> Non-recourse loans often have more complex operating covenants and restrictions</li><li><strong>Less lender flexibility:</strong> Non-recourse lenders are often less willing to modify or work out troubled loans</li></ul><p>For a deal where you have high confidence in the outcome, recourse financing at lower rates and higher leverage may produce better returns. Non-recourse is most valuable when there is meaningful execution risk — where you want to cap your personal downside.</p><h2>Negotiating Loan Guaranty Structure</h2><p>Between full recourse and full non-recourse lie several intermediate structures:</p><ul><li><strong>Partial recourse:</strong> Borrower is personally liable for a specific portion of the loan (e.g., 25% of the balance) but not the full amount</li><li><strong>Completion guaranty:</strong> For construction loans, personal liability only until the project is complete and leased (not for the ongoing loan)</li><li><strong>Payment guaranty vs. performance guaranty:</strong> Performance guaranty requires the borrower to complete obligations; payment guaranty requires actual monetary payment — different risk profiles</li></ul><p>At CLS CRE, we negotiate loan guaranty structures as part of every transaction. Understanding your personal risk tolerance, the deal's risk profile, and the lender market's current appetite for recourse and non-recourse structures allows us to match you with the right capital source and negotiate the most favorable terms. Never sign a loan document without fully understanding your personal liability exposure.</p>
