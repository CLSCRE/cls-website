Many developers specifically design projects to meet this 80% residential income threshold."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is LTC for mixed-use construction loans?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Loan-to-cost ratios for mixed-use construction loans typically range from 55-70% of total project cost, somewhat lower than single-use construction financing due to the added underwriting complexity. The equity requirement is 30-45% of total cost, contributed before or alongside loan funding."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is mixed-use financing more complex than single-use financing?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Mixed-use financing requires underwriting multiple asset classes simultaneously, each with different metrics (DSCR, occupancy standards, lease structures), valuation methodologies, and lender appetites. Most lenders specialize in one asset class and struggle with the multi-component analysis required for mixed-use projects."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What pre-leasing is required for a mixed-use construction loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most construction lenders require 30-50% pre-leasing of retail space before full loan funding. Office space may require similar pre-leasing. Residential units are typically underwritten on a speculative basis with absorption timeline assumptions. Some lenders require signed leases from anchor retail tenants before closing."}}]}

      <p>Mixed-use development — projects that combine residential, retail, office, and sometimes hotel uses within a single building or campus — has become the dominant development format in urban and suburban markets alike. Live-work-play environments appeal to millennials, empty nesters, and employers seeking walkable, amenity-rich locations. Municipalities favor them because they maximize land use efficiency, generate higher tax revenues, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.</p><p>But financing mixed-use developments is among the most complex challenges in commercial real estate. The multi-component nature of these projects creates underwriting complexity that trips up even experienced developers who are accustomed to single-use financing.</p><h2>Why Mixed-Use Financing Is Complex</h2><p>Lenders think in asset classes. A multifamily lender knows multifamily. A retail lender knows retail. A mixed-use building forces underwriters to evaluate multiple asset classes simultaneously, apply different valuation methodologies to each component, and assess how the components interact (Do the retail tenants benefit the residential? Does the office component create noise or traffic concerns for residents?).</p><p>Each use has different:</p><ul><li>Underwriting metrics (DSCR, occupancy, lease terms)</li><li>Comparable sales and rent data</li><li>Financing parameters (LTV, DSCR, term)</li><li>Lender appetite and risk tolerance</li></ul><p>The result is a loan request that crosses multiple lender departments and requires unusual coordination — which most lenders are not set up to handle efficiently.</p><h2>Common Mixed-Use Development Types</h2><ul><li><strong>Residential over retail:</strong> Ground-floor retail with apartments or condos above — the most common urban infill format</li><li><strong>Live-work units:</strong> Ground-floor commercial space attached to residential units, popular with artists and small businesses</li><li><strong>Office over retail:</strong> Traditional downtown format, facing challenges in 2026 due to office headwinds</li><li><strong>Hotel and residential:</strong> Branded residences above hotel lobbies — high complexity, trophy market projects</li><li><strong>Campus mixed-use:</strong> Multiple buildings with different uses on a master-planned site</li></ul><h2>Construction Financing for Mixed-Use</h2><p>Ground-up mixed-use development typically uses a single construction loan covering the entire project, with the lender underwriting each component separately and blending the results:</p><p><strong>Key construction loan parameters for mixed-use:</strong></p><ul><li>LTC: 55-70% of total project cost (lower than single-use due to added complexity)</li><li>Rate: SOFR + 350-550 bps</li><li>Term: 24-48 months (longer than single-use due to phased construction and lease-up)</li><li>Equity requirement: 30-45% of total cost</li><li>Pre-leasing requirements: Often 30-50% of retail space and sometimes office space before full loan funding</li></ul><p>Some lenders will only fund the residential component via construction loan and require the developer to pre-lease or pre-sell retail and office space. Others are comfortable with a fully speculative loan if the sponsor has a strong track record and the market data supports demand for all components.</p><h2>Permanent Financing for Mixed-Use</h2><p>Once the project is complete and stabilized, the construction loan must be replaced with permanent financing. Options include:</p><h3>Single Loan on the Entire Project</h3><p>Some CMBS lenders and life insurance companies will finance the entire mixed-use property under a single permanent loan, applying blended underwriting to each component. This is the simplest approach but requires finding a lender with appetite for the specific mix of uses.</p><p>Terms: 5.75%-6.75% fixed, 65-70% LTV on blended value, 10-year term.</p><h3>Separate Financing by Component</h3><p>An alternative is financing each component with the most optimal capital source:</p><ul><li><strong>Residential component:</strong> Agency debt (Fannie/Freddie) if 80%+ of revenue is residential, or conventional bank financing. Rates 5.25%-5.75%.</li><li><strong>Retail component:</strong> Separate loan with a bank or CMBS lender based on retail NOI. Rates 6.00%-6.75%.</li><li><strong>Office component:</strong> Bank financing if stabilized with credit tenants. Rates 6.25%-7.00%.</li></ul><p>This approach maximizes leverage and minimizes blended interest cost but creates operational complexity with multiple loans, lenders, and loan covenants to manage simultaneously.</p><h2>The 80/20 Agency Rule</h2><p>One of the most important rules in mixed-use financing: if at least 80% of gross income comes from the residential component, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will consider financing the entire project under their multifamily programs. This dramatically reduces the interest rate (to 5.25%-5.75%) and increases available leverage versus commercial alternatives.</p><p>Many urban mixed-use developers deliberately design projects to meet this 80% threshold — limiting ground-floor retail to a level that keeps residential revenue above 80% of total income.</p><h2>Key Underwriting Considerations</h2><p><strong>Retail lease terms:</strong> Retail leases of 5-10+ years with creditworthy tenants significantly improve the project's financing profile. Month-to-month or short-term retail occupancy makes lenders uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Residential stabilization:</strong> Lenders want to see 90%+ residential occupancy sustained for 3+ months before funding permanent financing.</p><p><strong>Shared expenses:</strong> How are common area expenses allocated between uses? Clear documentation of expense sharing — parking, lobbies, elevators — is important for underwriting.</p><p><strong>Condominium vs. rental:</strong> If the residential component is for-sale condominiums, construction financing uses different metrics (pre-sales percentage) and the permanent loan is replaced by individual condo mortgages as units close.</p><h2>Working With the Right Financing Partner</h2><p>Mixed-use development financing rewards developers who engage their financing team early in the design process. The difference between a project that qualifies for agency financing (5.50%) and one that does not can come down to the percentage of ground-floor retail — a design decision made 18 months before the loan is applied for.</p><p>At CLS CRE, we work alongside mixed-use developers from project conception through permanent takeout financing, advising on capital stack structure, lender selection, and timing. Our relationships with construction lenders, CMBS conduit lenders, life companies, and agency lenders ensure you have access to the best execution for every component of your project.</p>
