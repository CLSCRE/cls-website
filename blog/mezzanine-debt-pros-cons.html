      <p>When a senior lender will not provide enough debt to close a deal, and the sponsor does not want to dilute equity further, mezzanine debt enters the picture. It occupies the middle layer of the commercial real estate capital stack — subordinate to senior debt but senior to equity — filling the gap that makes otherwise challenging deals pencil. Understanding when mezzanine makes sense, and when it creates more problems than it solves, is essential for any sophisticated CRE investor.</p><h2>What Is Mezzanine Debt?</h2><p>Mezzanine debt (commonly called "mezz") is a loan secured not by a mortgage on the property itself, but by a pledge of the ownership interest (the LLC membership interest) in the property-owning entity. This subordinate position means the mezz lender is second in line for repayment after the senior lender — and before equity investors — in a default scenario.</p><p>Mezzanine debt is closely related to preferred equity, which achieves a similar economic position through a different legal structure. Both instruments exist to increase overall leverage in a transaction beyond what the senior lender will provide.</p><h2>Typical Mezzanine Loan Terms</h2><ul><li><strong>Position:</strong> Subordinate to first mortgage, senior to common equity</li><li><strong>LTV:</strong> Typically covers 70-85% of total capital stack (senior debt handles 55-70%, mezz covers the remaining 10-20%)</li><li><strong>Rate:</strong> 10%-15%+ in 2026, depending on risk profile and deal structure</li><li><strong>Term:</strong> Typically co-terminus with senior debt (3-5 years for bridge; up to 10 for permanent)</li><li><strong>Structure:</strong> Can be current-pay (monthly interest), accruing (interest added to balance), or a combination</li><li><strong>Intercreditor agreement:</strong> Required between senior and mezz lenders defining rights and remedies</li></ul><h2>When Mezzanine Debt Makes Sense</h2><h3>Bridging the Equity Gap</h3><p>The most common use case: a deal requires 70% leverage to achieve acceptable returns, but the senior lender will only go to 60%. A 10% mezz tranche fills the gap, allowing the sponsor to close without sourcing additional equity partners.</p><h3>Recapitalizing Existing Assets</h3><p>If you own a property with significant equity but want to pull cash out without refinancing the first mortgage (perhaps because you have a favorable fixed-rate senior loan), a mezz loan against the entity can extract liquidity without disturbing the senior debt.</p><h3>Acquisition Financing</h3><p>For value-add acquisitions where the business plan requires 75-80% total leverage, stacking a senior bridge loan with a mezz tranche achieves the needed proceeds while limiting the equity check required at close.</p><h3>Development Financing</h3><p>Some ground-up developers use mezz to reduce their equity contribution below the 35-45% typically required for construction loans, stretching sponsor capital across more projects simultaneously.</p><h2>The Pros of Mezzanine Debt</h2><ul><li><strong>Higher leverage:</strong> Access 75-85% of capital stack versus 60-70% with senior debt alone, reducing required equity capital.</li><li><strong>Preserves equity:</strong> Cheaper than bringing in an equity partner who shares in upside. If your deal generates a 20% IRR, paying 12% for mezz money is a significant arbitrage.</li><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Mezz lenders are often more creative than senior lenders in structuring deals around specific sponsor needs.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> Mezz lenders can often move faster than equity raises or partnership negotiations.</li></ul><h2>The Cons of Mezzanine Debt</h2><ul><li><strong>High cost:</strong> At 10%-15%+, mezzanine debt significantly increases your overall cost of capital and can turn a marginal deal negative if performance falls short.</li><li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The intercreditor agreement between senior and mezz lenders adds legal cost, negotiation time, and operational complexity throughout the loan term.</li><li><strong>Foreclosure risk:</strong> Mezz lenders can foreclose on the entity interest (taking ownership of the LLC) within 30-90 days of default — much faster than a traditional mortgage foreclosure.</li><li><strong>Senior lender approval:</strong> Most senior lenders must consent to mezzanine financing, and not all will agree. Banks are more restrictive than debt funds or CMBS lenders in this regard.</li><li><strong>Reduces margin for error:</strong> High leverage amplifies both gains and losses. If the business plan underperforms, the high blended cost of capital can quickly impair equity returns.</li></ul><h2>Mezzanine vs. Preferred Equity: What Is the Difference?</h2><p>Mezzanine debt and preferred equity achieve similar economic results — subordinate capital above the senior debt — but through different legal mechanisms:</p><p><strong>Mezzanine debt:</strong> Structured as a loan, secured by a pledge of the entity interest. The mezz lender has a creditor relationship and can foreclose quickly on default.</p><p><strong>Preferred equity:</strong> Structured as an equity investment, with the preferred investor owning a class of membership interests with priority returns. Enforcement on default typically requires a buyout of the preferred equity position.</p><p>Many senior lenders are more comfortable with preferred equity than mezzanine because it does not create a competing creditor. In practice, returns and risk profiles are similar — the choice often comes down to senior lender preferences and legal/tax considerations.</p><h2>Is Mezzanine Right for Your Deal?</h2><p>Mezzanine debt is a powerful tool when used appropriately — for deals with strong fundamentals and clear paths to value creation. It becomes dangerous when used to paper over a marginal deal or when the business plan has limited margin for execution risk.</p><p>At CLS CRE, we help clients evaluate the full capital stack — not just the senior debt. When mezz or preferred equity is the right tool, we have relationships with 50+ subordinate debt and preferred equity providers who actively seek CRE opportunities. When it is not the right tool, we say so. The goal is always to optimize your capital structure for risk-adjusted returns.</p>
