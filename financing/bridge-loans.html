Common uses include acquiring properties that need stabilization, funding renovations and lease-up, or providing quick capital for time-sensitive opportunities."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How fast can a bridge loan close?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bridge loans can close in as little as 2-4 weeks, compared to 45-90 days for permanent financing. This speed makes bridge loans ideal for competitive acquisition situations, auction purchases, and other time-sensitive transactions."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are typical bridge loan rates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bridge loan rates typically range from 6.79% to 13.04%, depending on the lender, leverage level, and property risk profile. Rates are higher than permanent financing to compensate for the shorter term and transitional nature of the asset."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a non-recourse bridge loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Many debt funds and institutional bridge lenders offer non-recourse bridge loans, particularly for larger transactions ($5M+). Non-recourse bridge loans are subject to standard carve-out guarantees similar to permanent financing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the exit strategy for a bridge loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The typical exit strategy for a bridge loan is refinancing into permanent financing once the property is stabilized (fully leased and generating sufficient cash flow). Alternatively, the exit may be a property sale, construction loan conversion, or another bridge loan if more time is needed."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What collateral is required for a bridge loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bridge loans are secured by the commercial property itself, just like permanent financing. Lenders may also require personal guarantees (recourse), though non-recourse options are available. Additional collateral such as cross-collateralization or cash reserves may be required for higher-risk situations."}}]}

  <p class="reveal">Bridge lending fills the gap between acquisition or current state and permanent financing eligibility. Common use cases include acquiring a property that doesn't yet qualify for permanent debt, funding tenant improvements and lease-up, providing time for entitlement and permitting, or bridging to a construction loan start. Sources include debt funds, private lenders, and select banks willing to provide transitional capital.</p>
