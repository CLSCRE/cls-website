    "description": "Permanent loans provide long-term, fixed-rate financing for stabilized commercial real estate assets. These loans typically feature 5 to 25-year terms with competitive rates from banks, life insurance companies, CMBS conduits, and agency lenders. Ideal for cash-flowing properties with stable occupancy, permanent financing locks in predictable debt service and maximizes long-term returns.",
    "description_extended": "As the most common form of commercial real estate financing, permanent loans serve as the backbone of investment strategy for owners seeking to hold and operate income-producing properties. Sources include traditional banks, credit unions, life insurance companies, CMBS lenders, and government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for multifamily assets. Each source offers different advantages in terms of rate, leverage, flexibility, and prepayment structure.",

Lenders include banks, debt funds, and specialized construction lenders.",
