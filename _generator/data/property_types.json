    "description": "Multifamily properties are the most actively financed asset class in commercial real estate. From small 5-unit apartment buildings to large 500+ unit communities, multifamily assets benefit from the broadest range of financing sources including agency lenders (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac), banks, life insurance companies, CMBS conduits, and debt funds.",
    "description_extended": "The multifamily sector consistently attracts strong capital flows due to fundamental housing demand, favorable demographics, and government-backed lending programs. Agency financing through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offers the most competitive long-term rates with non-recourse terms, while bank and life company options provide flexibility for portfolio borrowers. CLS CRE specializes in multifamily financing across all subtypes, from conventional apartments to manufactured housing communities.",

Financing is widely available from banks, life insurance companies, CMBS lenders, and debt funds for warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, and flex/R&D space.",
    "description_extended": "The industrial sector benefits from strong tenant demand, low vacancy rates, and favorable rent growth trends across most major markets. Lenders view industrial assets favorably due to long-term lease structures, creditworthy tenants, and relatively low capital expenditure requirements.

Creditworthy tenancy and long-term lease structures drive the most competitive terms, with strong net lease assets qualifying for life insurance company and CMBS financing. Community and neighborhood centers with grocery anchors remain attractive to bank and agency lenders.",
    "description_extended": "While retail has evolved significantly with the growth of e-commerce, well-located, well-tenanted retail properties continue to generate strong returns and attract financing.

    "description_extended": "Mixed-use financing requires lenders comfortable with multiple income streams and use types within a single property. Vertical mixed-use (retail ground floor with apartments above) is the most common structure, followed by horizontal mixed-use developments.
